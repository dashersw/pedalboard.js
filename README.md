stomp.js
========

stomp.js is the future dream of guitar freaks.

Coded entirely in JavaScript, stomp.js gives you a - growing - collection of stomp boxes. With the powerful JavaScript Audio API, one can implement any effect as easy as writing a few lines of JavaScript.

stomp.js also gives you a basis for implementing your own stomp boxes. With a clean interface and visual components, you can build your own ideas into your own stomp boxes in minutes.

Future plans
------------
Currently, the UI is very limited. In the coming weeks, stomp.js will feature a floorboard abstraction, routing between individual stomp boxes and drag and drop support.

As the JavaScript Audio API is currently unavailable to stream audio directly from your favorite input (sound card - line-in or mic); one can just use static samples. As time permits, hopefully line-in support will come and we'll be riding waves on JavaScript.
